\title{Posterior Predictive Checks}
\description{
  This may be used to predict either new, unobserved instances of
  \eqn{\textbf{y}}{y} (called \eqn{\textbf{y}^{new}}{y[new]}) or
  replicates of \eqn{\textbf{y}}{y} (called
  \eqn{\textbf{y}^{rep}}{y[rep]}), and then perform posterior
  predictive checks. Either \eqn{\textbf{y}^{new}}{y[new]} or
  \eqn{\textbf{y}^{rep}}{y[rep]} is predicted given an object of
  class \code{vb}, the model specification, and data. This function
  requires that posterior samples were produced with
  \code{\link{VariationalBayes}}.
}
\usage{\method{predict}{vb}(object, Model, Data, CPUs=1, Type="PSOCK", \dots)}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{An object of class \code{vb} is required.}
  \item{Model}{The model specification function is required.}
  \item{Data}{A data set in a list is required. The dependent
    variable is required to be named either \code{y} or \code{Y}.}
  \item{CPUs}{This argument accepts an integer that specifies the number
    of central processing units (CPUs) of the multicore computer or
    computer cluster. This argument defaults to \code{CPUs=1}, in which
    parallel processing does not occur.}
  \item{Type}{This argument specifies the type of parallel processing to
    perform, accepting either \code{Type="PSOCK"} or
    \code{Type="MPI"}.}
  \item{\dots}{Additional arguments are unused.}

\details{
  Since Variational Bayes characterizes marginal posterior
  distributions with modes and variances, and posterior predictive
  checks involve samples, the \code{predict.vb} function requires
  the use of independent samples of the marginal posterior
  distributions, provided by \code{\link{VariationalBayes}} when
  \code{sir=TRUE}.

  The samples of the marginal posterior distributions of the target
  distributions (the parameters) are passed along with the data to the
  \code{Model} specification and used to draw samples from the deviance
  and monitored variables. At the same time, the fourth component in the
  returned list, which is labeled \code{yhat}, is a vector of
  expectations of \eqn{\textbf{y}}{y}, given the samples, model
  specification, and data. To predict \eqn{\textbf{y}^{rep}}{y[rep]},
  simply supply the data set used to estimate the model. To predict
  \eqn{\textbf{y}^{new}}{y[new]}, supply a new data set instead (though
  for some model specifications, this cannot be done, and
  \eqn{\textbf{y}_{new}}{y[new]} must be specified in the \code{Model}
  function). If the new data set does not have \eqn{\textbf{y}}{y}, then
  create \code{y} in the list and set it equal to something sensible,
  such as \code{mean(y)} from the original data set.

  The variable \code{y} must be a vector. If instead it is matrix
  \code{Y}, then it will be converted to vector \code{y}. The vectorized
  length of \code{y} or \code{Y} must be equal to the vectorized length
  of \code{yhat}, the fourth component of the returned list of the
  \code{Model} function.

  Parallel processing may be performed when the user specifies
  \code{CPUs} to be greater than one, implying that the specified number
  of CPUs exists and is available. Parallelization may be performed on a
  multicore computer or a computer cluster. Either a Simple Network of
  Workstations (SNOW) or Message Passing Interface is used (MPI). With
  small data sets and few samples, parallel processing may be slower,
  due to computer network communication. With larger data sets and more
  samples, the user should experience a faster run-time.

\value{
  This function returns an object of class \code{vb.ppc} (where
  ``ppc'' stands for posterior predictive checks). The returned object
  is a list with the following components:
  \item{y}{
    This stores \eqn{\textbf{y}}{y}, the dependent variable.}
  \item{yhat}{
    This is a \eqn{N \times S}{N x S} matrix, where \eqn{N} is the
    number of records of \eqn{\textbf{y}}{y} and \eqn{S} is the number of 
    posterior samples.}
  \item{Deviance}{
    This is a vector of length \eqn{S}, where \eqn{S} is the number of
    independent posterior samples. Samples are obtained with the
    sampling importance resampling algorithm, \code{\link{SIR}}.}
  \item{monitor}{
    This is a \eqn{N \times S}{N x S} matrix, where \eqn{N} is the
    number of monitored variables and \eqn{S} is the number of independent
    posterior samples. Samples are obtained with the sampling importance
    resampling algorithm, \code{\link{SIR}}.}
