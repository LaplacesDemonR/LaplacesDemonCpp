The multivariate Laplace distribution is a multidimensional extension of
the one-dimensional or univariate symmetric Laplace distribution. There
are multiple forms of the multivariate Laplace distribution.

The bivariate case was introduced by Ulrich and Chen (1987), and the
first form in larger dimensions may have been Fang et al. (1990), which
requires a Bessel function. Alternatively, multivariate Laplace was soon
introduced as a special case of a multivariate Linnik distribution
(Anderson, 1992), and later as a special case of the multivariate power
exponential distribution (Fernandez et al., 1995; Ernst, 1998). Bayesian
considerations appear in Haro-Lopez and Smith (1999). Wainwright and
Simoncelli (2000) presented multivariate Laplace as a Gaussian scale
mixture. Kotz et al. (2001) present the distribution formally. Here, the
density is calculated with the asymptotic formula for the Bessel
function as presented in Wang et al. (2008).

The multivariate Laplace distribution is an attractive alternative to
the multivariate normal distribution due to its wider tails, and remains
a two-parameter distribution (though alternative three-parameter forms
have been introduced as well), unlike the three-parameter multivariate t
distribution, which is often used as a robust alternative to the
multivariate normal distribution.

In practice, \eqn{\textbf{U}}{U} is fully unconstrained for proposals
when its diagonal is log-transformed. The diagonal is exponentiated
after a proposal and before other calculations. Overall, the Cholesky
parameterization is faster than the traditional parameterization.
Compared with \code{dmvl}, \code{dmvlc} must additionally
matrix-multiply the Cholesky back to the covariance matrix, but it
does not have to check for or correct the covariance matrix to
positive-definiteness, which overall is slower. Compared with
\code{rmvl}, \code{rmvlc} is faster because the Cholesky decomposition
has already been performed.

\value{
  \code{dmvlc} gives the density, and
  \code{rmvlc} generates random deviates.
