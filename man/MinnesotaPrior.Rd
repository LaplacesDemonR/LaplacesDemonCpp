\title{Minnesota Prior}
\description{
  The Minnesota prior, also called the Litterman prior, is a shrinkage
  prior for autoregressive parameters in vector autoregressive (VAR)
  models. There are many variations of the Minnesota prior. This
  Minnesota prior is calculated as presented in Lutkepohl (2005,
  p. 225), and returns one or more prior covariance matrices in an
  array.

\usage{
MinnesotaPrior(J, lags=c(1,2), lambda=1, theta=0.5, sigma)
}
\arguments{
  \item{J}{This is the scalar number of time-series in the VAR.}
  \item{lags}{This accepts an integer vector of lags of the
    autoregressive parameters. The lags are not required to be
    successive.}
  \item{lambda}{This accepts a scalar, positive-only hyperparameter that
    controls how tightly the parameter of the first lag is concentrated
    around zero. A smaller value results in smaller diagonal variance.}
  \item{theta}{This accepts a scalar hyperparameter in the interval
    [0,1]. When one, off-diagonal elements have variance similar or
    equal to diagonal elements. When zero, off-diagonal elements have
    zero variance. A smaller value is associated with less off-diagonal
    variance.}
  \item{sigma}{This accepts a vector of length \eqn{J} of residual
    standard deviations of the dependent variables given the
    expectations.}

\details{
  The Minnesota prior was introduced in Doan, Litterman, and Sims
  (1984) as a shrinkage prior for autoregressive parameters in vector
  autoregressive (VAR) models. The Minnesota prior was reviewed in
  Litterman (1986), and numerous variations have been presented since.
  This is the version of the Minnesota prior as described in Lutkepohl
  (2005, p. 225) for stationary time-series.

  Given one or more \eqn{J \times J} matrices of autoregressive
  parameters in a VAR model, the user specifies two tuning
  hyperparameters for the Minnesota prior: \code{lambda} and
  \code{theta}. Each iteration of the numerical approximation algorithm,
  the latest vector of residual standard deviation parameters is
  supplied to the \code{MinnesotaPrior} function, which then returns an
  array that contains one or more prior covariance matrices for the
  autoregressive parameters. Multiple prior covariance matrices are
  returned when multiple lags are specified. The tuning hyperparameters,
  \code{lambda} and \code{theta}, can be estimated from the data via
  hierarchical Bayes.

  It is important to note that the Minnesota prior does not technically
  return a covariance matrix, because the matrix is not symmetric, and
  therefore not positive-definite. For this reason, a Minnesota prior
  covariance matrix should not be supplied as a covariance matrix to a
  multivariate normal distribution, such as with the \code{\link{dmvn}}
  function, though it would be accepted and then (incorrectly)
  converted to a symmetric matrix. Instead, \code{\link{dnormv}} should
  be used for element-wise evaluation.

  While the Minnesota prior is used to specify the prior covariance for
  VAR autoregressive parameters, prior means are often all set to zero,
  or sometimes set to an identity matrix.

  An example is provided in the Examples vignette.
