\title{Cumulative Sample Function}
\description{
  The Cumulative Sample Function (CSF) is a visual MCMC diagnostic in
  which the user may select a measure (such as a variable, summary
  statistic, or other diagnostic), and observe a plot of how the measure
  changes over cumulative posterior samples from MCMC, such as the
  output of \code{\link{LaplacesDemon}}. This may be considered to be a
  generalized extension of the \code{cumuplot} in the coda package,
  which is a more restrictive form of the cusum diagnostic introduced by
  Yu and Myckland (1998).

  Yu and Myckland (1998) suggest that CSF plots should be examined after
  traditional trace plots seem convergent, and assert that faster mixing
  chains (which are more desirable) result in CSF plots that are more
  `hairy' (as opposed to smooth), though this is subjective and has been
  debated. The \code{LaplacesDemon} package neither supports nor
  contradicts the suggestion of mixing and `hairiness', but suggests
  that CSF plots may be used to provide additional information about a
  chain. For example, a user may decide on a practical
  \code{\link{burnin}} given when a conditional mean obtains a certain
  standard error.

\usage{
CSF(x, name, method="Quantiles", quantiles=c(0.025,0.500,0.975), output=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{This is a vector of posterior samples from MCMC.}
  \item{name}{This is an optional name for vector \code{x}, and is input
    as a quoted string, such as \code{name="theta"}.}
  \item{method}{This is a measure that will be observed over the course
    of cumulative samples of \code{x}. It defaults to
    \code{method="Quantiles"}, and optional methods include: \code{"ESS"},
    \code{"Geweke.Diagnostic"}, \code{"HPD"}, \code{"is.stationary"},
    \code{"Kurtosis"}, \code{"MCSE"}, \code{"MCSE.bm"},
    \code{"MCSE.sv"}, \code{"Mean"}, \code{"Mode"}, \code{"N.Modes"},
    \code{"Precision"}, \code{"Quantiles"}, and \code{"Skewness"}.}
  \item{quantiles}{This optional argument applies only when
    \code{method="Quantiles"}, in which case this vector indicates the
    probabilities that will be observed. It defaults to the median and
    95\% probability interval bounds (see \code{\link{p.interval}} for
    more information).}
  \item{output}{Logical. If \code{output=TRUE}, then the results of the
    measure over the course of the cumulative samples will be output as
    an object, either a vector or matrix, depending on the \code{method}
  argument. The \code{output} argument defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\details{
  When \code{method="ESS"}, the effective sample size (ESS) is observed
  as a function of the cumulative samples of \code{x}. For more
  information, see the \code{\link{ESS}} function.

  When \code{method="Geweke.Diagnostic"}, the Z-score output of the
  Geweke diagnostic is observed as a function of the cumulative samples
  of \code{x}. For more information, see the
  \code{\link{Geweke.Diagnostic}} function.

  When \code{method="HPD"}, the Highest Posterior Density (HPD) interval
  is observed as a function of the cumulative samples of \code{x}. For
  more information, see the \code{\link{p.interval}} function.

  When \code{method="is.stationary"}, stationarity is logically
  tested and the result is observed as a function of the cumulative
  samples of \code{x}. For more information, see the
  \code{\link{is.stationary}} function.

  When \code{method="Kurtosis"}, kurtosis is observed as a function of
  the cumulative samples of \code{x}.

  When \code{method="MCSE"}, the Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE)
  estimated with the \code{IMPS} method is observed as a function of
  the cumulative samples of \code{x}. For more information, see the
  \code{\link{MCSE}} function.

  When \code{method="MCSE.bm"}, the Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE)
  estimated with the \code{batch.means} method is observed as a
  function of the cumulative samples of \code{x}. For more information,
  see the \code{\link{MCSE}} function.

  When \code{method="MCSE.sv"}, the Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE)
  estimated with the \code{sample.variance} method is observed as a
  function of the cumulative samples of \code{x}. For more information,
  see the \code{\link{MCSE}} function.

  When \code{method="Mean"}, the mean is observed as a function of
  the cumulative samples of \code{x}.

  When \code{method="Mode"}, the estimated mode is observed as a
  function of the cumulative samples of \code{x}. For more information,
  see the \code{\link{Mode}} function.

  When \code{method="N.Modes"}, the estimated number of modes is
  observed as a function of the cumulative samples of \code{x}. For
  more information, see the \code{\link{Modes}} function.

  When \code{method="Precision"}, the precision (inverse variance) is
  observed as a function of the cumulative samples of \code{x}.

  When \code{method="Quantiles"}, the quantiles selected with the
  \code{quantiles} argument are observed as a function of the
  cumulative samples of \code{x}.

  When \code{method="Skewness"}, skewness is observed as a function of
  the cumulative samples of \code{x}.
