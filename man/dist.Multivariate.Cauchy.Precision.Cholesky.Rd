\title{Multivariate Cauchy Distribution: Precision-Cholesky Parameterization}
\description{
  These functions provide the density and random number generation for
  the multivariate Cauchy distribution. These functions use the
  precision and Cholesky parameterization.
}
\usage{
dmvcpc(x, mu, U, log=FALSE)
rmvcpc(n=1, mu, U)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{This is either a vector of length \eqn{k} or a matrix with 
       a number of columns, \eqn{k}, equal to the number of columns in
       precision matrix \eqn{\Omega}{Omega}.}
  \item{n}{This is the number of random draws.}
  \item{mu}{This is a numeric vector representing the location parameter,
       \eqn{\mu}{mu} (the mean vector), of the multivariate
       distribution. It must be of length \eqn{k}, as defined above.}
  \item{U}{This is the \eqn{k \times k}{k x k} upper-triangular matrix
    that is Cholesky factor \eqn{\textbf{U}}{U} of the positive-definite
    precision matrix \eqn{\Omega}{Omega}.}
  \item{log}{Logical. If \code{log=TRUE}, then the logarithm of the
       density is returned.}

The multivariate Cauchy distribution is a multidimensional extension
of the one-dimensional or univariate Cauchy distribution. A random
vector is considered to be multivariate Cauchy-distributed if every
linear combination of its components has a univariate Cauchy
distribution. The multivariate Cauchy distribution is equivalent to a
multivariate t distribution with 1 degree of freedom.

The Cauchy distribution is known as a pathological distribution because
its mean and variance are undefined, and it does not satisfy the central
limit theorem.

It is usually parameterized with mean and a covariance matrix, or in
Bayesian inference, with mean and a precision matrix, where the
precision matrix is the matrix inverse of the covariance matrix. These
functions provide the precision parameterization for convenience and
familiarity. It is easier to calculate a multivariate Cauchy density
with the precision parameterization, because a matrix inversion can be
avoided.

This distribution has a mean parameter vector \eqn{\mu}{mu} of length
\eqn{k}, and a \eqn{k \times k}{k x k} precision matrix
\eqn{\Omega}{Omega}, which must be positive-definite. The precision
matrix is replaced with the upper-triangular Cholesky factor, as in
\code{\link{chol}}.

In practice, \eqn{\textbf{U}}{U} is fully unconstrained for proposals
when its diagonal is log-transformed. The diagonal is exponentiated
after a proposal and before other calculations. Overall, Cholesky
parameterization is faster than the traditional parameterization.
Compared with \code{dmvcp}, \code{dmvcpc} must additionally
matrix-multiply the Cholesky back to the covariance matrix, but it
does not have to check for or correct the precision matrix to
positive-definiteness, which overall is slower. Compared with
\code{rmvcp}, \code{rmvcpc} is faster because the Cholesky decomposition
has already been performed.
