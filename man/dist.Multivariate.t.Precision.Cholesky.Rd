\title{Multivariate t Distribution: Precision-Cholesky Parameterization}
\description{
  These functions provide the density and random number generation for
  the multivariate t distribution, otherwise called the multivariate
  Student distribution. These functions use the precision and Cholesky
  parameterization.
}
\usage{
dmvtpc(x, mu, U, nu=Inf, log=FALSE)
rmvtpc(n=1, mu, U, nu=Inf)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{This is either a vector of length \eqn{k} or a matrix with 
       a number of columns, \eqn{k}, equal to the number of columns in
       precision matrix \eqn{\Omega}{Omega}.}
  \item{n}{This is the number of random draws.}
  \item{mu}{This is a numeric vector representing the location parameter,
       \eqn{\mu}{mu} (the mean vector), of the multivariate distribution
       (equal to the expected value when \code{df > 1}, otherwise
       represented as \eqn{\nu > 1}{nu > 1}). It must be of length
       \eqn{k}, as defined above.}
  \item{U}{This is a \eqn{k \times k}{k x k} upper-triangular of the
       precision matrix that is Cholesky fator \eqn{\textbf{U}}{U} of
       precision matrix \eqn{\Omega}{Omega}.}
  \item{nu}{This is the degrees of freedom \eqn{\nu}{nu}, which must be
       positive.}
  \item{log}{Logical. If \code{log=TRUE}, then the logarithm of the
       density is returned.}

The multivariate t distribution, also called the multivariate Student or
multivariate Student t distribution, is a multidimensional extension of the
one-dimensional or univariate Student t distribution. A random vector is
considered to be multivariate t-distributed if every linear
combination of its components has a univariate Student t-distribution.

It is usually parameterized with mean and a covariance matrix, or in
Bayesian inference, with mean and a precision matrix, where the
precision matrix is the matrix inverse of the covariance matrix. These
functions provide the precision parameterization for convenience and
familiarity. It is easier to calculate a multivariate t density
with the precision parameterization, because a matrix inversion can be
avoided. The precision matrix is replaced with an upper-triangular
\eqn{k \times k}{k x k} matrix that is Cholesky factor
\eqn{\textbf{U}}{U}, as per the \code{\link{chol}} function for Cholesky
decomposition.

This distribution has a mean parameter vector \eqn{\mu}{mu} of length
\eqn{k}, and a \eqn{k \times k}{k x k} precision matrix
\eqn{\Omega}{Omega}, which must be positive-definite. When degrees of
freedom \eqn{\nu=1}{nu=1}, this is the multivariate Cauchy distribution.

In practice, \eqn{\textbf{U}}{U} is fully unconstrained for proposals
when its diagonal is log-transformed. The diagonal is exponentiated
after a proposal and before other calculations. Overall, the Cholesky
parameterization is faster than the traditional parameterization.
Compared with \code{dmvtp}, \code{dmvtpc} must additionally
matrix-multiply the Cholesky back to the precision matrix, but it
does not have to check for or correct the precision matrix to
positive-definiteness, which overall is slower. Compared with
\code{rmvtp}, \code{rmvtpc} is faster because the Cholesky decomposition
has already been performed.
