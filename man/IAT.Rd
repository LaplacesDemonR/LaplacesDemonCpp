\title{Integrated Autocorrelation Time}
\description{
  The \code{IAT} function estimates integrated autocorrelation time,
  which is the computational inefficiency of a chain or MCMC
  sampler. IAT is also called the IACT, ACT, autocorrelation time,
  autocovariance time, correlation time, or inefficiency factor. A lower
  value of \code{IAT} is better. \code{IAT} is a MCMC diagnostic that is
  an estimate of the number of iterations, on average, for an
  independent sample to be drawn, given a chain or Markov chain. Put
  another way, \code{IAT} is the number of correlated samples with the
  same variance-reducing power as one independent sample.

  IAT is a univariate function. A multivariate form is not included.

\details{
  \code{IAT} is a MCMC diagnostic that is often used to compare chains
  of MCMC samplers for computational inefficiency, where the sampler
  with the lowest \code{IAT}s is the most efficient sampler. Otherwise,
  chains may be compared within a model, such as with the output of
  \code{\link{LaplacesDemon}} to learn about the inefficiency of the
  chain. For more information on comparing MCMC algorithmic
  inefficiency, see the \code{\link{Compare}} function.
  
  \code{IAT} is also estimated in the \code{\link{PosteriorChecks}}
  function. \code{IAT} is usually applied to a stationary chain after
  discarding burn-in iterations (see \code{\link{burnin}} for more
  information). The \code{IAT} of a chain correlates with the
  variability of the mean of the chain, and relates to Effective Sample
  Size (\code{\link{ESS}}) and Monte Carlo Standard Error
  (\code{\link{MCSE}}).

  \code{IAT} and \code{\link{ESS}} are inversely related, though not
  perfectly, because each is estimated a little differently. Given
  \eqn{N}{N} samples and taking autocorrelation into account,
  \code{\link{ESS}} estimates a reduced number of \eqn{M}{M} samples.
  Conversely, \code{IAT} estimates the number of autocorrelated samples,
  on average, required to produce one independently drawn sample.
  
  The \code{IAT} function is similar to the \code{IAT} function in the
  \code{Rtwalk} package of Christen and Fox (2010), which is currently
  unavailabe on CRAN.
