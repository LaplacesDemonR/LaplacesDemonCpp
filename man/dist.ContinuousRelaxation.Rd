\description{
  This is the density function and random generation from the continuous
  relaxation of a Markov random field (MRF) distribution.

It is often easier to solve or optimize a problem with continuous
variables rather than a problem that involves discrete variables. A
continuous variable may also have a gradient, contour, and curvature
that may be useful for optimization or sampling. Continuous MCMC
samplers are far more common.

Zhang et al. (2012) introduced a generalized form of the Gaussian
integral trick from statistical physics to transform a discrete variable
so that it may be estimated with continuous variables. An auxiliary
Gaussian variable is added to a discrete Markov random field (MRF) so
that discrete dependencies cancel out, allowing the discrete variable to
be summed away, and leaving a continuous problem. The resulting
continuous representation of the problem allows the model to be updated
with a continuous MCMC sampler, and may benefit from a MCMC sampler that
uses derivatives. Another advantage of continuous MCMC is that
stationarity of discrete Markov chains is problematic to assess.

A disadvantage of solving a discrete problem with continuous parameters
is that the continuous solution requires more parameters.
