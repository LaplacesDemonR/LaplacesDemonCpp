LaplacesDemonCpp
=============

C++ Extension of LaplacesDemon

The LaplacesDemonCpp package consists of C++ functions that replace functions written in R in LaplacesDemon. For more information, see the LaplacesDemon package.

LaplacesDemonCpp imports parallel, Rcpp, and RcppArmadillo.

This package should be considered experimental until further along in development. The optimization of C++ functions will improve with time.
